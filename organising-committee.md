# Roles and Responsibilities within the Organising Committee (OC)

## Introduction

One of the first things that need to be done in the organisation of ISWC is in the formation of the **Organising Committee (OC)**. Ideally, the *General Chair* should invite (and have them accept) chairs for each of the roles ***at least one year prior to the event*** (i.e. typically before the previous year's ISWC conference). This is typically done once the location (and the identity of local chair) has been finalised by [SWSA](https://swsa.semanticweb.org); so that the invitees can ascertain if they can attend the conference.

Traditionally, SWSA offers comments and advice on the key roles: primarily the chairs of the main tracks (Research, Resources, In-Use).  Therefore, when drawing up a shortlist, the *General Chair* should consult SWSA before reaching out to individuals.

**Diversity is important** for the OC (gender, geographical, etc.), so please be mindfull of this.  It is also possible to check the manes of previous chairs by consulting the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169mThBN6U09JvH_cILnV5rih2WIJz3kClfV4kXJeick/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Likewise, where possible, consider identfying a mix of individuals with experience together with those who have not served on previous ISWC OCs. nominations.

Note that in past years, come invitiees may not respond promptly (or at all) to invitations, so factor in possible delays in the formation of the new OC.

## Time Line

* ***>12-18 months*** 

	* Aim to finalise the Chair positions at least one year before the prior ISWC Conference.  Ideally, the Website should be launched at that conference and list details of all members of the Organising Committee.

* ***12 months (at prior ISWC Conference)*** 

	* Ideally the *General Chair* (or if not possible, someone to represent the OC) should attend the previous year's ISWC to attend:
		* the Town Hall meeting (to garner current feedback), 
		* the OC Lunch (typically on the last day, where the main chairs of the prior and new ISWC and be introduced and can exhange details etc), and 
		* the closing ceremony, where a presentation of your event should be launched (typically with a video presentation) in coordination with SWSA and the prior *Local Chairs*.

## Chair Positions and Responsibilities

Each of the chair positions are listed below.  Typically, two chairs are appointed for each role to ensure robustness and resilience for each role, though having three, though unusual, is not unheard of.  It is rare to have one chair - but if this is done, avoid this on time-critical roles. The list of roles below reflects the main roles, but these can vary with each conference edition (for example, the inclusion of the *Job Fair Chair* in 2025 or the *Visionary Ideas Track Chair* in 2026).
