## Notes, Tips and useful Resorces

* The Local Chairs should also have the homepage up with the OC and conference dates before the prior ISWC. Stefan Decker controls the semanticweb.org domain, so once you have an IP, get the local organisers to send it to Stefan to create an A-Record.


* **TIP**: Getting the website, domain, logo, banner, etc., ready can take time so this process should be started several months prior to the previous ISWC. The website is crucial and getting it up early is very *very* important\!  

* **TIP**: In ISWC 2024, the Local Chairs decided to hire a company to manage the website. This created significant delays as the company had certain policies and processes in place (e.g., 3 weeks to set up a custom domain). Be wary of this decision. Getting a couple of trustworthy, responsive PhDs or Postdocs to manage a WordPress instance or lightweight solution will be a lot more agile.
