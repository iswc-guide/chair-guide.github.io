# Congratulations on being General Chair of ISWC\!

The aim of this guide is to aid in the running of the conference, and to pass on best practice.  Therefore it should be seen as a living (evolving) document to aid future chairs\! Although the guide is not meant to be a complete step-by-step instruction manual, it has been reorganised to provde direction and advice regarding the different aspects of the conference organisation, including a summary of things that might not be obvious, or that you should watch out for.

The guide has been structured to cover the different phases and activities, and is not meant to be prescriptive.  Each section includes a list of *notes, tips and resources* that should be updated each year, to ensure that the guide is always up to date and is useful.

## Overview

As *General Chair*, you’ll probably have been invited two years prior to the conference date. Typically, nominations for **hosting the conference** (together with the **dates of the conference itself**) are submitted to [SWSA](https://swsa.semanticweb.org) two years in advance, typically with the proposer as the **Local Chair** (that heads the local organisation team). Once the decision has been made, the **General Chair** should coordinate to clarify the roles that each will take.  Details of these roles can be found in the Section on the [Organisation Committee](organising-committee).

## Notes, Tips and useful Resorces

* SWSA has a set of documents that include an official guide for General Chairs, past statistics for ISWC, etc. For example, the [General Chair guide is here](https://swsa.semanticweb.org/private/guide-iswc-conference-chairs). In case this was not shared with you, you may need to contact SWSA to solicit an account (Ian Horrocks seems to manage the logins, at least as of 2024).
